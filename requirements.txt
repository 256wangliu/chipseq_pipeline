#r ==2.15.3 (conflict), this will be later installed (with --force; ignoring dependencies)

#### wrong environment
# picard ==1.97
## picard tool does not have a shell variable PICARDROOT and jar is not picard.jar but picard-1.97.jar
## a softlink picard.jar will be created and linked to it in install_dependencies.sh
## also PICARDROOT will be defined in conda activate.

#### packages not available in official channels
# align2rawsignal ==2.0
# mcr ==2010b

#### run install_dependencies.sh to install these packages
